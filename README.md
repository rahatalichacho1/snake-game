Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game project! This classic arcade game is implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

About the Game
The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow larger. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls of the game area or with the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, making the game more challenging.
